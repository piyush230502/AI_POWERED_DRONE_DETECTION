**Introduction **

The AI-Powered Drone Detection project is a state-of-the-art solution that leverages artificial intelligence to detect drones in various environments. With the increasing use of drones across industries such as delivery, surveillance, and recreation, there is a growing need to identify unauthorized or suspicious drone activity for security purposes. This project addresses the challenge by using advanced computer vision techniques and deep learning models to detect drones accurately.
The system is designed to process input images or video frames and classify whether a drone is present. It integrates a trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, a leading real-time object detection framework, to ensure high precision and speed. The solution is complemented by a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions, making it accessible to security personnel, researchers, and enthusiasts.
This project underscores the power of AI in addressing modern challenges, ensuring safety and surveillance in critical areas.

**Project Objectives **

The primary objectives of this project include:
Developing an accurate drone detection system using deep learning techniques.
Training and fine-tuning a YOLO model to detect drones in diverse conditions.
Designing a lightweight and efficient solution capable of real-time processing.

Ensuring the system is robust, scalable, and adaptable for integration into larger security frameworks.
This project aims to combine technological innovation with practical usability, offering a reliable tool for drone detection and monitoring.

**Methodology**
The project is structured into several stages:

**1. Dataset Preparation**
The project relies on a diverse dataset containing images of drones in various environments, including urban, rural, and aerial settings. The dataset is annotated to include bounding boxes around drones, ensuring the model learns to locate and classify them accurately.

**2. Model Selection and Training**
A pretrained YOLO model is fine-tuned for drone detection. The YOLO framework is chosen for its balance of speed and accuracy, making it ideal for real-time applications. Training involves:
Data Augmentation: Enhancing the dataset with transformations like rotation, scaling, and color adjustments to improve generalization.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting parameters like learning rate and batch size to optimize model performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Using precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision) to measure model effectiveness.

**3. Model Deployment**
The trained model (best.pt) is integrated into a Python-based back-end using Flask. The predict.py script in the prediction directory handles real-time inference.

**4. Web Application Development**
A user-friendly interface is created using HTML templates (index.html). Users can upload images through this web app and receive predictions.

**5. Utility Scripts**
The utils.py file contains utility functions for image preprocessing and post-processing, ensuring seamless integration of the model and application.

**Challenges Faced**

Developing the drone detection system presented several challenges:
Dataset Quality and Diversity: Gathering a diverse dataset with drones in varying conditions, such as different lighting, backgrounds, and drone types, was critical for achieving robust model performance.
Model Optimization: Fine-tuning the YOLO model to balance accuracy and inference speed required extensive experimentation with hyperparameters and training techniques.
Real-Time Performance: Ensuring the system could process images quickly while maintaining accuracy was challenging, especially for high-resolution inputs.
Web App Integration: Integrating the trained model into a Flask web application involved resolving compatibility issues and ensuring smooth interaction between the front-end and back-end.
False Positives/Negatives: Addressing cases where the model misclassified objects as drones (false positives) or failed to detect drones (false negatives) required iterative improvements in training and validation.
Despite these challenges, the project successfully delivered a reliable and efficient solution.
